## Usage

Your dataset should be a csv file with the following columns:
```csv
start_time, stop_time
```


In the command line, run the following command:

```bash
$> python3 time_diff.py <your_dataset.csv>
```

The output will be a csv file with the same name as the input file, with the suffix `_diff.csv` added.
